      <h2>Retailer: 70% faster releases</h2>
      <div class="grid two">

        <div>
          <p>At a national retail chain, outdated release processes slowed deployment cycles from weeks to months. Ajmerican designed a Kubernetes-based platform using GitOps for continuous integration and delivery. Automated pipelines, standardized containerization and DevOps training helped teams release features at the pace of business.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>CI/CD pipelines built with GitOps and Kubernetes</li>
            <li>Standardized container images and Helm charts</li>
            <li>Release cycle reduced from four weeks to one week</li>
            <li>Development teams empowered with self‑service deployments</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h2>Insurer: 40 % infra cost reduction</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <img src="assets/new_img/data_analytics.jpg" alt="Insurer">
        <div>
          <p>Our client faced skyrocketing cloud bills and unpredictable performance. We right‑sized their infrastructure, optimized autoscaling policies and introduced data‑tiering strategies to keep hot data in memory and cold data on cost‑effective storage.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Comprehensive infrastructure audit and rightsizing</li>
            <li>Predictive autoscaling tuned for peak demand</li>
            <li>Storage tiering between memory, SSD and object stores</li>
            <li>40 % lower cloud spend with maintained SLAs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Clinic: unified analytics</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <img src="assets/new_img/artificial_intelligence.jpg" alt="Clinic">
        <div>
          <p>A multi‑site clinic struggled with siloed EMR systems and manual reporting. Ajmerican implemented a modern data warehouse on BigQuery with automated ELT pipelines. A governed semantic layer delivered a single source of truth for physicians, while dashboards provided near real‑time insights into patient outcomes and operational efficiency.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Automated ELT pipelines from disparate EMR systems</li>
            <li>BigQuery warehouse with governed semantic layer</li>
            <li>Self‑service dashboards for clinicians and administrators</li>
            <li>Improved data quality and faster decision making</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h2>Manufacturer: GenAI copilot</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <img src="assets/new_img/artificial_intelligence.jpg" alt="Manufacturer">
        <div>
          <p>An industrial manufacturer wanted to reduce service‑desk workloads and speed up troubleshooting. We built an AI copilot integrated with the existing knowledge base to recommend fixes, draft maintenance instructions and learn from technician feedback, cutting average handle time by over a third.</p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Copilot trained on manuals and past support tickets</li>
            <li>Conversational interface integrated into support workflows</li>
            <li>Continuous learning from technician feedback</li>
            <li>35 % reduction in average handle time and higher satisfaction</li>
